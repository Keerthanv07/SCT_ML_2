Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
This project is part of my internship work and focuses on segmenting mall customers into distinct 
groups based on their annual income and spending score using K-Means Clustering. The model uses the Elbow Method to
determine the optimal number of clusters and visualizes the grouped customer segments.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
pandas – For loading and handling the dataset
matplotlib – For data visualization
scikit-learn – For preprocessing, clustering with KMeans, and model evaluation
